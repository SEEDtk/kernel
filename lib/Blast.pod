=head1 genome.distance blast

=head2 Introduction

The C<genome.distance blast> command performs a BLAST command in the SEEDtk environment.  Its primary
advantage is the possibility of visual HTML output.

The BLAST is performed between a query stream and a subject database.  You specify either of these things
with a I<type> and a I<file name>, and the program will figure out the correct BLAST parameters and add
any genetic code translation parameters automatically.  The file name can refer to a FASTA file or
a L<GenomeTypeObject> file.

The type indicates the type of file and what information to extract.

=over 4

=item db

File is an existing BLAST database

=item dna

File is a DNA FASTA file.

=item prot

File is a protein FASTA file.

=item contigs

File is a GTO file.  The contigs will be extracted as DNA sequences.

=item pegs

File is a GTO file.  The proteins will be extracted a protein sequences.

=item features

File is a GTO file.  The features will be extracted as DNA sequences.

=item pegs_dna

File is a GTO file.	The proteins will be extracted as untranslated DNA sequences.

=back

When you are specifying the subject file, it will be converted into a BLAST database.  Use the C<--keep>
option to keep the BLAST database from being deleted.

The file types and names are specified as positional parameters.  So, the following BLASTs the DNA FASTA file
C<assembled.fa> against the proteins in the genome C<83333.1.gto>.  The BLAST database will be put in temporary
files and deleted at the end of the run.

    genome.distance blast dna assembled.fa pegs 83333.1.gto >results.html

The standard output should always be piped, as log messages go to STDERR.

The default report format is HTML, with each query sequence shown as a horizontal line and the subject
sequence hits shown as colored arrows below it.  The colors indicate the percent identity.  All of these
things are configurable.  You can specify sorting by subject sequence instead (so that each subject sequence
is a horizontal line and the query sequence hits are arrows), you can specify that the color scheme be based
on percent similarity or coverage of the target sequence, or you can specify one of two tab-delimited textual
report formats.

=head2 Command-Line Options

The following BLAST parameters and result filters are supported as command-line options.

=over 4

=item --gc

Genetic code of the DNA.  The genetic code is stored in genome GTO files and in BLAST databases created by
this program.  So this is generally not required.  The default is C<11>.

=item --max

The maximum number of hits to return for each query.  The default is C<100>.

=item --maxE

The maximum permissible e-value for a hit.  The default is C<1e-10>.

=item --minIdent

The minimum permissible percent identity for a hit.  The default is C<0>.

=item --minQuery

The minimum permissible coverage for a query sequence.  This is the percent of positions in the entire
query sequence (not just the hit) that are identical or positive in the hit.  The default is C<0>.

=item --minSubject

The minimum permissible coverage for a subject sequence.  This is the percent of positions in the entire
subject sequence (not just the hit) that are identical or positive in the hit.  The default is C<0>.

=item --threads

The number of threads to run in the BLAST process.

=back

The following command-line options affect reporting.

=over 4

=item --format

The format of the report.

=over 8

=item HTML

A web page showing the visual nature of the hits.  This is the default.

=item TABLE

A tab-delimited file with headers describing each hit.  Sections of the output relating to a single sequence
are separated by blank lines.

=item ALIGN

A tab-delimited file with headers showing the alignment sequences for each hit.  Each hit is represented
by two lines of output, and each pair of lines is separated by a blank line.

=back

=item --color

The color scheme for HTML reports.  A color key is shown at the top of the web page, but essentially blue is 100%,
green is 90% or better, orange is 70% or better, red is 50% or better, and dark gray is less than 50%.  The colors
are vaguely inspired by traffic lights.

=over 8

=item ident

The color reflects the percent identity for the hit.  This is the default.

=item sim

The color reflects the percent similarity (identical + positive) for the hit.

=item covg

The color reflects the percent coverage of the target sequence for the hit.  The target sequence is the one
indicated by the arrow.  The arrow shows visually how much of the anchor sequence is covered by the hit because
of its relationship to the horizontal line.  The color gives you an indication of how much of the other sequence
participated.

=back

=item --sort

The type of anchor sequence.  The anchor sequence type determines how the output is sorted.  You can sort by C<>QUERY>
or C<SUBJECT>.  The sort order for the anchor sequences is a natural sort by the sequence label.
So, C<fig|83333.2.peg.4> sorts before C<fig|83333.10.peg.1>, because C<4> is less than C<10>.  Features within a
genome are sorted in the preferred manner as well:  C<fig|83333.1.peg.4> comes before C<fig|83333.1.peg.20>.
Similarly, when sorting contigs from a SPAdes assembly, the sequences will be sorted by node numbers.  This makes
it much easier to tell which sequences or features are missing.  The default is C<QUERY>, so in the default case,
you will see the results grouped by query sequence, and in the HTML report, each horizontal line will be a query
sequence, with the subject sequence hits shown as arrows.

=back

The following parameters affect the operation of this program.

=over 4

=item --keep

If a BLAST database is created, keep all the files.  Normally, any files created to build the BLAST database are deleted.

=item --batch

The number of queries to submit to BLAST each time it is run.  This is used to break up the query stream.  The default is
C<20>.

=item --dir

The working directory.  If any of the inputs are GTO files, the FASTA files spooled out from them are put in the
working directory.  The default is the current directory.

=item --verbose

Display more detailed progress messages.  This includes output from B<makeblastdb> as well as the IDs of query
sequences that have no hits.

=head2 Examples

BLAST RNAseq data from C<assembly_1.fasta> against the contigs of the genome in the file C<100226.1.gto>.  The
BLAST database will be created in subdirectory C<Temp> and deleted after use.  The output will be a web page
showing each RNA sequence with the contig hits shown as arrows below.

    genome.distance blast --dir Temp dna assembly_1.fasta contigs 100226.1.gto >results.html

BLAST RNAseq data from C<assembly_1.fasta> against the protein sequences of the genome in the file
C<100226.1.gto>.  The BLAST database will be created in the current directory and kept after completion.  The
output will be a web page showing each RNA sequence with the protein hits shown as arrows below.  The
colors will indicate how much of the protein sequence matched the query.

    genome.distance blast --keep --color covg dna assembly_1.fasta pegs 100226.1.gto >results.html

BLAST the contigs from the genome in the file C<100226.1.gto> against the protein sequences in the FASTA file
C<Proteins/universals.fa>.  The BLAST database support files will be created in the subdirectory C<Proteins>
(where the subject FASTA file is located), and deleted after use.  The output will be a flat file showing
alignments, sorted by protein sequence label.

    genome.distance blast --sort SUBJECT --format ALIGN contigs 100226.1.gto prot Proteins/universals.fa >results.txt
